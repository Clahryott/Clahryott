👋 Oh Hey, Welcome!

I’m currently participating in the She Codes Plus Program and learning to HTML, CSS, Python, Django, JavaScript, React and REST.

A litte bit about the She Codes Plus Program, it's all about elevating the female presence within tech and making the tech industry more diverse. It's a competitive and intensive bootcamp to empower and prepare women for a career in the tech industry. I've been fortunate to be one of 27 women in the 2022/2023 cohort to gain a place and recieve a Scholarship.

👀 I’m interested in all things design and UX/UI...
✅ Diploma of Design (Graphic Design)

⏳  I’m currently learning to code, so bare with me as I find my way and develop my skills... If you have any feedback or any tips and tricks you might have, I'd love to hear from you!

📫 Want to connect, feel free to drop me a message and just say Hi. It's great to meet others like me.
